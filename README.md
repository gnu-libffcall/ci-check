This repository only does continuous integration.

The project's code is being developed at https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/libffcall .

Before running the CI, you need to unpack the newest "make dist" tarball here,
and rename its main directory to 'libffcall'.  This is necessary, because
creating all the .S and .s files requires dozens of cross-compilers.
